title: Farewell Valley Forge Tech
description: Saying my goodbyes to Valley Forge Tech Meetup.
---

Back in January 2014, I wrote about [Commitment](/2014/01/13/commitment.html).  As a result, [Kari Bancroft](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kariabancroft) and I started [Valley Forge Tech Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/valleyforgetech/).  Having lived and worked in the King of Prussia area for the past ten years, I knew there were loads of talented people with no surrounding support community.  I had always wanted to get involved with the tech/start-up scene but attending Meetups in Center City can be challenging.

Valley Forge Tech was formed in early 2014 with the intention of running bi-monthly Meetups ranging from community meet and greets to demo days.  Turns out we **severely underestimated** the demand for a tech meetup in the Philadelphia suburbs.  We went from scheduling Meetups every two months to scheduling two-four every month.  The numbers of 'techies has grown from an initial two (Kari and myself) to 425 - an average of **7 new members a week**!  Out of those, we have about 100 active members with an average Meetup size of about 25-30 people.

Spending the past year building Valley Forge Tech with Kari has been a blast.  I've met amazing people, had some great discussions, learned a heck of a lot and, of course, ate copious amounts of pizza.  Unfortunately, it's time for me to call it quits.  In July I was offered a job opportunity that I could not pass up.  I have since moved half way around the world making it difficult to assist Kari in managing VFT and scheduling events.  As of today I will be stepping down as co-founder of Valley Forge Tech Meetup.  But fear not - Kari isn't going anywhere and will keep things rolling into 2015 and beyond.  Please keep in touch - a widget with all my contact info is on the top right of this page.

On a last departing note, I wanted to give a very big thank you to everyone who helped us get things off the ground and hosted an event.  None of this would have been possible without you.

Hope to see you around,<br />
