<strong>Exciting News:</strong> I'm thrilled to announce the launch of <a href="https://www.ratiorender.com/">Ratio Render</a>!

Ratio Render is a service built for web developers looking to enhance the visual dynamics of their websites. It enables one to dynamically render image placeholders based on aspect ratios.

Gone are the days of feeling constrained by fixed dimensionjpg or png images. Ratio Render serves up SVGs that not only maintain their aspect ratios but scale infinitely. This means a more flexible and responsive approach to image rendering, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes and resolutions.

Built with Node, powered by AWS Lambda, and deployed via Terraform, Ratio Render provides a robust image rendering solution for modern web development challenges. The incorporation of cutting-edge technologies ensures reliability, scalability, and lightning-fast performance.

Here's a fun rainbow build with Ratio Render:
