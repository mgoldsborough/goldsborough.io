I'm excited to share my first ever [TEDx](https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program_) talk! 

Admittedly, it's not perfect. Managing my video and audio recording equipment, along with the strict 2-minute time limit, proved challenging for someone who can be a bit verbose at times 😅.

Nevertheless, the message is an important one. The global population is burgeoning, and we need to identify new ways to produce sustainable sources of protein without having an impact on the environment.

At Forever Oceans, we believe we have achieved just that. We've developed innovative technology that enables us to raise high-quality, sashimi-grade fish sustainably in the deep ocean. Our software platform allows us to monitor the fish in real-time from anywhere in the world.

Watch the whole TEDx video to learn more:

I welcome any feedback.
