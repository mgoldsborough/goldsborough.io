About two weeks ago a new version of *f.lux* was released and was immediately on the front page of Hacker News with a
[ton of favorable comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6559077). I'm always on the look out for great software
so I figured I'd see what the big deal was. Turns out it's awesome!

If you're a half-vampire like me and late nights in front of your computer are the norm AND you've never used f.lux **you're missing out!**
*f.lux* is an awesome little utility that dims your screen based on your location and time of day. In short, it makes your
monitor bright in the morning and dim at night. You might not think you don't mind the brightness but I challenge you 
to use f.lux for a week. After a week, stop f.lux around 11PM.  Guaranteed your eyes don't react to well - mine didn't.
There's also a lot of supporting [research](http://justgetflux.com/research.html) on the benefits of dimming your 
monitors at night although I haven't had a chance to read through it all. All I know is my eyes don't kill me at night anymore.

*f.lux* works on Windows, Mac and Linux. Stop waiting and [just get f.lux](http://justgetflux.com)!

**Update:** If you're a Ubuntu user I've posted a how-to on installing *f.lux* on
Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit with multi-monitor support [here]({% post_url 2013-10-28-install-flux-ubuntu-13-04-64-bit %}).
