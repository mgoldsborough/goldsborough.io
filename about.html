<h1 class="py-3">ðŸ‘‹ Hi there.</h1>

<p>
  I'm Mat, a Technologist, coder, and results-driven leader boasting over 15 years of diverse expertise and notable 
  accomplishments in automation technologies, software and hardware engineering, and entrepreneurship. I'm passionate about 
  leveraging technology to create lasting positive impact, and committed to developing and empowering top talent
  to achieve their full potential.
</p>

<p>
  I consult at <a href="https://www.onlyonet.com/">Only One T</a>, where I specialize in technology strategy,
  modern software architecture, devops and automation, website design, SEO, and PPC advertising. I've played a key role in
  the successful launch of numerous ventures within the realms of SaaS, digital advertising, and mobile application
  development, contributing to their notable success. Whether you're looking to hire or connect, feel free to reach 
  out at <strong>hello [at] onlyonet.com</strong></a>.
</p>

<p>
  In 2023, I joined the talented engineering team at <a href="https://www.daily-harvest.com/">Daily Harvest</a>. I'm 
  actively involved in reimagining, restructuring, and rearchitecting our backend eCommerce systems to boost performance, 
  enhance efficiency, and save costs.
</p>

<p>
  In 2014, I partnered with a remarkable team to establish <a href="https://www.foreveroceans.com/">Forever Oceans</a>, the world's first vertically integrated open-ocean 
  aquaculture company. Over the course of a decade, we built a global team of rock star engineers, scientists, and technicians, 
  successfully raised over $115M in venture funding, and deployed the world's first truly open-ocean fish farms in Hawai'i and Panama.
  As CTO, I led the development and deployment of multiple large-scale automated fish farms and pioneered several 
  innovative patented technologies.
</p>

<p>
  Prior to Forever Oceans, I worked for Lockheed Martin where I served in a lead engineer capacity across multiple domains
  including cyber security, space situational awareness, and command and control systems. I was the Chief Technologist on the 
  Lockheed Aquaculture team which was spun out in 2014 to become Forever Oceans.
